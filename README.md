# My-Portfolio
My personal portfolio (that will continue to be updated as I learn more skills) using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Handlebars, and Tailwind CSS.

In this Portfolio, I've used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and eye-pleasing website that will serve as the template for my portfolio as I continue to learn more software development skills.

In the HTML, there is a solid structure that includes:
- a header
- a title
- a meta
- a linked style sheet and an external font family sourced from Google
- a nav
- multiple section elements
- interactive buttons as well as an input and text area for the 'contact me' section

I have also added buttons to directly link to my LinkedIn and GitHub, which were styled in the CSS, see below. The nav bar contains local links that will direct you to 'About Chris', 'Projects', and 'Contact Me'.

I have also included a placeholder image for my projects as I prepare to deploy the links in the future as well as an alt for all the images on the project for accessibility.

I have also included CSS features, queries, and functions to add functionality to the website.

Some of these include: 
- a root (for a consistent color palette)
- a header that includes: justify-content, font size, and letter spacing - to manipulate it visually
- features in the body include: a linear gradient for a smooth and consistent color palette throughout the website, an external font family referenced above, and center-aligned text
- I also manipulated the button: a transparent background so it follows the website styling, border + radius (for styling), and a changing cursor upon hover
- The links were also manipulated: added a hover feature which underlines the links and matched color to website styling
- the `nav`, `p`, and `main` sections were left quite basic, with the main functionality of being legible, accessible, and easy to see
- the `.card` sections are 'inline-block' so they are next to each other and stack with a smaller screen, this is followed by a hover section so there is added functionality to the feature
- in the images in the main section, I added a hover feature by manipulating opacity; it is set at 50% but will change to 100% on hover (I added a color of white though I'm not sure this actually does much)
- the projects section were given some basic CSS styling, padding, gaps, and height- they were mostly sized through view height(vh) measurement but I kept the gap and padding at (px) to remain the same when screen size changes

Regarding media queries, a couple of things I added:
- multiple viewing changes on the screen, 1200px, 900px, and 768px
  - at 1200px, the header size will change and so will the buttons
  - at 900px, the colors of the headers, paragraph, and the main will change colors. The font size will also change
  - at 768px, the `.card` section will stack, and header font size will also change
